# Weatherly Weather Website

## Project Description
Weatherly is a weather website where users can access the current weather and 7-day forecast in their area or in cities worldwide. When users first see the page there should only be one weather card for their current location and they can add more cities by typing in the city name or zip code in the search bar at the top. All the cities the user has added on the page will be remembered for future visits and can be easily removed using the button in the top right corner of each card.

This weather website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node. I used the OpenWeatherMap API for all weather data and flaticon.com for all icons used on the website. The icons are created by Those Icons of flaticon.
